# Python OpenAI Tool-Calling Example

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of OpenAI's function calling feature within a continuous loop.

## Setup

1.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the client

**Run the main script:**
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will start running, continuously making API calls, handling tool calls, and printing the results to the console.
